We provide datasets for 3 different alloy systems we tested as part of our study.

We have provided a simple data module in QCE to interact with the datasets. 

Furthermore, we save the datasets as .json and .csv that will enable easy transfer across different versions and platforms for any future studies.

* **Dataset 1**: 64 atoms supercell composed of varying amounts of [Ni-Cu-Pd-Ag]. 
  * The initial structure used was a FCC supercell 
  * The structures are then relaxed using DFT and the relaxed energies are used to calculate the mixing energies
  * Dataset provided contains initial structures and their corresponding relaxed mixing energies

* **Dataset 2**: 96 atoms supercells encompassing mixed [Hf-V-Y-Ce-Fe-Co-Ru-Zr]O<sub>2</sub> oxide alloys
  * The initial structure used was a ZrO<sub>2</sub> supercell
  * The structures are then relaxed using DFT and the relaxed energies are used to calculate the mixing energies
  * Dataset provided contains initial structures and their corresponding relaxed {mixing energies+band centers}

* **Dataset 3**: 72 atoms supercells encompassing mixed [W-Cr-Mn-Ti-Co-Sb-V-Ru]O<sub>2</sub> oxide alloys
  * The initial structure used was a rutile RuO<sub>2</sub> supercell
  * The structures are then relaxed using DFT and the relaxed energies are used to calculate the mixing energies
  * Dataset provided contains initial structures and their corresponding relaxed {mixing energies+band centers}
